				<h2>Building a modern, accessible and performant user experience</h2>
					<p>I joined Which? in January 2022 and we have been on a rapid process of improvement. A major area of work I’ve been leading on has been our recent brand and proposition refresh. We've used this an opportunity to not only improve the user experience of our product offering – but also shift perceptions of what people can expect from Which?.</p>
					<p>Iterations we’ve made to our websites global navigation and IA has brought successful outcomes. We’ve seen a 19% increase in overall clickthroughs from the global navigation and a whopping 300% increase in clickthroughs to our tools and services offering. This was a primary area of focus as we endeavour to make users more aware of the range of ways we can help them. </p>
					<p>Another big area of focus has been helping people through the cost of living crisis. We’ve developed a range of content initiatives and tools to help people improve their financial situation. We’ve also been making major strides in improving the performance and accessibility of our website and app.</p>

					<p>More information on my work at Which? will be added soon.</p>
