				<h2>Building a modern, accessible and performant user experience</h2>
					<p>I joined Which? in January 2022 and we have been on a rapid process of improvement. A major area of work I've been leading on has been our recent brand and proposition refresh. We've used this an opportunity to not only improve the user experience of our product offering – but also shift perceptions of what people can expect from Which?.</p>
					<p>Other major areas of focus have been helping people through the cost of living crisis. We've developed a serious of content initiatives and tools to help people improve their financial situation. We've also been making major strides in improving the performance and accessibility of our website and app.</p>

					<p>More information on my work at Which? will be added soon.</p>
