				<h1>Government <br> as a Platform<span class="project-link">— <a href="https://governmentasaplatform.blog.gov.uk/">VISIT THE GAAP BLOG</a></span></h1>

				
				<h2>Building for a more dynamic public service landscape</h2>
					<p>I was part of a small exploration team tasked with doing some big picture thinking around how GDS could help support a more dynamic service landscape in the public sector. How we could build platforms that could cater for a future where the public sector had a much more agile digital service infrastructure that was being iterated constantly. A public service infrastructure that was built on structured data foundations and wasn't tied to old legacy IT.</p> 

					<p>We spent a few months experimenting in this area, developing proofs of concept and identifying next steps.</p>

				<h2>A common platform approach</h2>
					<p>After an extensive period of research with service teams across government it became clear repetition was often occurring in service delivery. Government was waisting time and money working in silos and building the same things time and time again.</p>

					<p>We examined the most prominent commonalities across government services and realised we could create a set of common platforms that would make user-centred public services easier to create and cheaper to run.</p>

				<h2>Creating a series of start-up teams</h2>
					<p>We prioritised the areas where this approach would benefit citizens and government most and began setting up agile product teams to test the viability of delivering these common platforms. Some of the platforms we looked to create included a notifications platform, a payments platform, a hosting platform, a web chat platform, a structured data platform and a form-builder platform.</p>

					<p>I led design across the platforms, working at a micro and macro level with the multidisciplinary delivery teams. I helped guide the strategic vision while also getting stuck into the nuts and bolts of delivering the platforms based on user needs.</p>

				<h2>Identifying our core user groups</h2>
					<p>We had different user groups we were designing for when developing these platforms. Citizens were a core user group, along with the public servants building and running government services. The <a href="https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2019/10/04/making-our-admin-tools-more-consistent/">admin tools</a> we developed for these platforms were designed based on extensive user research with the people who'd be using them daily.</p>

				<h2>Creating a framework for delivery</h2>
					<p>Running multiple platforms under one programme of work means there needs to be appropriate structures in place to enable effective feedback loops across teams and senior management. I led on developing a set of principles that became the delivery framework for the platforms we were developing.</p>
					<p>The creation of this delivery framework was an inclusive and open process that involved multiple colleagues from different disciplines across the organisation.</p>

				<h2>Focusing on adoption</h2>
					<p>We realised early on that ease of adoption was key to service teams using our platforms. We invested a lot of time researching potential blockers to adoption across the platforms and prioritised features based on user needs.</p> 

					<p>These common platforms are now used by thousands of services around government. They save tax-payer money and offer a better experience for users. They also save the teams building government services a lot of time, allowing them to focus on the problems bespoke to their service.</p>
